# JC3MP-Freeroam-Unlimited-commands
Just some random commands I made you may use, enjoy
Simply drop these into the freeroam package's commands folder and you're good to go

Some of these use the jcmp-toast popups to display responses, so either use that package as well or edit them so it sends text messages in chat
